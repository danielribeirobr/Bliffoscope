Bliffoscope Data Analysis Problem

It's April 1, 2143. Your job is to save the world.

Well, a little world. Specifically the asteroid X8483-Z-32 that you and Alphonso Bliffageri are
stuck on. You've been stranded there ever since the evil Rejectos hit your spaceship with a
slime torpedo fired from one of their spaceships. Now you and Alphonso are trying to save
your little world from a concerted Rejectos attack.

The main problem you have is detecting the Rejectos spaceships and slime torpedos, because
they're protected with cloaking devices. Alphonso has invented an imaging anti-neutrino
system (which he has modestly named the “Bliffoscope”) that provides the only information
you have about their location, but it's not very good information.

First, the Bliffoscope only detects whether there are anti-neutrinos at any particular point on an image, not what their
intensity is. In other words, the data it provides is the equivalent of a black-and-white image.
Second, the data is very noisy – even if there are no targets in a particular area, some pixels
will be “on”, and if there is a target, some of its pixels will be “off”.
